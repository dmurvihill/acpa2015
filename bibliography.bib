    Describes a method for achieving co-residence with target VMs on the cloud and exploiting information leakage between these VMs using Amazon's EC2 service as an example. The attack takes advantage of the fact that many VMs can be created by the same user, and that there is a possibility that these might run on the same hardware as a target due to the way the VMs share physical resources. Once co-location is achieved, an attacker can use side-channels (namely caches) to get information about the other instances running on the same machine as the malicious VM.  
    \par
    A 'map' of the EC2 service was constructed in order improve the likelihood of placing a VM on the same host as the target. By creating multiple instances for each permutation of the creation parameters, the authors observed a trend between internal IP addresses and creation parameters. These internal IP addresses were concluded to be statically associated with physical machines. Use of the created map requires translating the external IP of the target to an internal IP, which is made possible by the DNS service provided by EC2.
    \par
    There are multiple ways to check if two instances are co-resident. This can be done by comparing either Dom0 IP addresses or internal IPs and by measuring the round-trip packet times. The Dom0 IP check was used for all subsequent co-location testing as experiments showed that it produced no false positives.
    \par
    Two strategies were used to prove that achieving co-residence was possible. The first used a brute-force technique, creating a large number of probes that checked for co-location with any of a large set of targets. This method achieved a reasonable success rate, covering 8.4\% of the targets. A second method monitored a victim server, waiting for it to disappear when not needed, then reappear as a new instance. Based on experimentally observed parallel placement locality (instances launched at around the same time tend to be placed on the same hardware), the attacker then ran many instances using the same creation parameters as the target. This was much more successful, achieving co-residence 40\% of the time.
    \par
    Finally, the authors describe attacks which can be carried out on a co-resident VM. By measuring cache usage, an attacker can determine co-location without using the techniques described earlier. Cache usage can also be used to estimate traffic to a web server or measure the length of time between keystrokes for the purpose of recovering a password.

    Demonstrates a practical, fast, and realistic full key recovery against AES across virtual machines.
    The attack is based on the \name{Flush+Reload} attack from Gullasch \latin{et al.} \cite{gullasch2011cache}.
    It works against any T-table based cipher implementation, but only when the VMs are using same sort of memory
      sharing mechanism such as VMware TPS.
    Key recovery takes about one minute (400,000~encryptions) in a realistic cross-VM setting.

    The attack assumes the use of the co-location technique invented by Ristenpart \latin{et al.} to move to the same
      host as the target VM.
    Once co-located, it uses a \name{Flush+Reload} attack, which works in three steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \emph{flush} the cache lines which the attacker wants to observe
      \item wait for the target to run the interesting fragment of code such as an encryption
      \item \emph{reload} the same memory lines; the cache lines which the target accessed will be cached, and will
        load faster for the attacker.
    \end{enumerate}

    Specifically, the \name{Flush+Reload} targets accesses of the T table used in the final round of encryption.
    By observing accesses of the final T table, the attacker is able to observe the final-round state of the algorithm
      and can use this information, together with the ciphertext, to recover the key.

    The attack takes advantage of two isolation leaks which the target system relies on to improve performance: The
      fact that identical memory pages (such as libraries) are usually shared between virtual machines, and the fact
      that L3 cache is usually shared between cores.
    The first property allows the attacker to observe the target's memory access across VMs, the second allows the
      attacker to observe memory access across CPU cores.
    As a result, the attacker and target need only be sharing the same physical host.

    Irazoqui \latin{et al.} tested their implementation on a consumer VM running VMware ESXi. The target was an
      encryption server which accepted plaintexts and responded with ciphertexts.
    The attack program ran on a different VM on a different core of the same host and was able to send encryption
      requests to the target.
    It recovered the full key in 400,000 encryptions --- less than a minute.
    They also tested their approach and observed even better results in some non cross-VM situations.
